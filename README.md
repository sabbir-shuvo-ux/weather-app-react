# Weather App

This Weather App is a sleek and user-friendly application created using React. It displays the current weather and provides a 7-day forecast using a weather API. With a responsive design and intuitive interface, users can easily access accurate weather information for their location or any specified area.

I used Weatherbit API to get current weather condition and forecast for next 7 days. If you want to run it locally, you will need an API key from https://www.weatherbit.io. After get the key follow the ## Run Locally instruction
